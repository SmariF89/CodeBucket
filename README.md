# CodeBucket

CodeBucket is a web application which enables users to write, store, share and co-edit their code. All in the cloud.


NOTE: The project used to rely on an external SQL server which is no longer available. Thus, the project will not work as intended. It should be a worthy pastime, sometime, to restore the project's SQL data storage capabilities by creating a new SQL server using a code-first approach.
